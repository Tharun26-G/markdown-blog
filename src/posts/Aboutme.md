# About Me

Hi, I'm **Tharun** ðŸ‘‹  
I enjoy coding, testing, and transforming ideas into real products.

Iâ€™m into both development and testing, and Iâ€™m always jotting down new ideas to build.  
Some turn into full projects, others stay in the notes app â€” either way, Iâ€™m always creating something.  
Whether big or small, I love building things that work.

When Iâ€™m not shipping code, youâ€™ll probably find me:
- Watching tech videos  
- Playing chess  
- Planning my next travel break  
- Or just vibing offline  

ðŸ’¡ Open to new opportunities
